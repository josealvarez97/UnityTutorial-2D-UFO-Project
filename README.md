Up to [this commit](https://github.com/josealvarez97/UnityTutorial-2D-UFO-Project/commit/4a0c20e12797b0c291e0256857b619d56ea08d78) (see description), the 2D UFO Game was developed based on the [official tutorials from the Unity documentation](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-ufo-tutorial). ***After** such commit, any addition represents input of **my own creativity and authorship.*** I must say that I'm definitely grateful with Unity technologies for making such great tutorials. However, again, from now on the evolution of this project will be my original input.
